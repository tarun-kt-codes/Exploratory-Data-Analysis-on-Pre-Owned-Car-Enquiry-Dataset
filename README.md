## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in any data analysis project. It involves examining and understanding the dataset's characteristics, distributions, patterns, and relationships among variables. In this project, we perform EDA on a pre-owned car dataset to uncover insights that could influence decision-making processes in the used car market.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of pre-owned car listings with various attributes. The attributes in the dataset are as follows:

- DEALER CODE-FOR CODE
- DEALER_NAME
- DLR_CITY
- ENQ_NUM
- ENQ_DATE
- CUST_NAME
- CUST_MOBILE
- CUST_PROFESSION
- USAGE_AREA
- EMAIL_ID
- DSE_NAME
- DSE_DESIGNATION
- BUYER_TYPE
- MANUFACTURER
- MODEL
- SUBMODEL
- SUB_MODEL_DESC
- COLOUR
- BUDGET
- AGE_OF_OLD_CAR
- REG_NO1
- ENQ_SOURCE
- TEST_DRIVE
- TEST_DRIVE_NO
- ENQ_MODE
- ENQ_STATUS
- MSPIN
- CUST_GENDER
- ENQ_DAY
- CAR_TYPE

## Installation

To run the code and reproduce the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDA-pre-owned-car-dataset.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd EDA-pre-owned-car-dataset
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using:
   ```
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script included in the repository. These files contain the code for loading the dataset, performing data cleaning, conducting exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different visualizations, and customize the analysis according to your preferences.
